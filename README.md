# Internship Projects (Demonstration Repository)

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of **controlled demonstration projects** that I worked on during my internship period.  
These projects are **not industry-grade production systems** and are **not intended to represent my full technical capability**.

Their purpose is to:
- Demonstrate **core computer vision concepts used in industry**
- Validate **algorithmic understanding**
- Experiment with **model behavior, limitations, and trade-offs**
- Serve as **internal demos / POCs**, not deployable products

I am intentionally transparent about this to avoid misrepresentation.

## Important Disclaimer (Read This)

These projects are:
-  **Not production-ready**
-  **Not optimized for scale**
-  **Not benchmarked against SOTA**
-  **Not hardened for real-world edge cases**

They are:
- Conceptual implementations
- Prototype-level demos
- Used to understand how real systems are built internally
- Common *entry-level* tasks used inside companies for onboarding, testing, or rapid experimentation

If you are looking for **full-scale systems, agent pipelines, large-model training, or deployment architectures**, this repo is **not the right place**. Those exist separately.

## Project List

### 1. Camera Zoom In & Out – AI Enhancement
- Simulates AI-assisted zooming using interpolation and enhancement techniques
- Focus: visual consistency during scale changes
- Scope deliberately limited to image-level experimentation

### 2. Image Deblurring
- Demonstration of classical and deep-learning-based deblurring concepts
- Focus: understanding blur kernels, restoration behavior, and failure cases
- Not trained or tuned for real-world motion blur diversity

### 3. Video Deblurring
- Frame-based video deblurring prototype
- Focus: temporal consistency challenges
- No real-time constraints or deployment optimizations applied

### 4. Gender Detection
- Simple classification demo
- Built strictly as a **technical exercise**, not a real-world application
- No bias mitigation, ethics review, or dataset balancing applied

### 5. Object Addition
- Basic object insertion and manipulation demo
- Focus: image compositing and masking logic
- Not a generative or scene-aware system

### 6. Types of Blurs
- Visual exploration of different blur types
- Educational purpose only
- Helps understand degradation models used in restoration tasks

### 7. Zoom In and Out
- Non-AI baseline zoom experiment
- Included for comparison against AI-enhanced approaches

## Why These Projects Exist

These projects were used during my internship to:
- Quickly test ideas
- Validate assumptions
- Learn how **real industrial pipelines are structured internally**
- Understand **what breaks** when models leave notebooks

They helped me:
- Earn consistent positive evaluations
- Receive an **excellent intern award for consecutive months**
- Get promoted to a **team leadership role during the internship**

## What This Repository Is NOT

To be very clear:
- This is **not** a showcase of advanced research
- This is **not** my strongest work
- This is **not** a measure of my ceiling

It is a **foundation layer**, not the building.

## For Reviewers / Recruiters

If you are evaluating my profile:
- Treat this repo as **baseline competency evidence**
- Not as a representation of advanced system design or research depth

For deeper, scalable, or production-level work, please refer to:
- Dedicated repositories
- Research-oriented projects
- Agent-based systems
- End-to-end ML pipelines

## Final Note

I prefer **honest engineering representation** over hype.

These projects show **where I started**, not **where I stop**.
